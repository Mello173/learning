# I am creating everything in this folder/repo as a way to learn Git and Github and how to use them together or seperately. 

# This website is not going to be published anywhere or anything like that, but it is a small about me website to allow me to test my skills in the HTML, CSS, and a couple other languages at the same time as I learn git.

# This was created while I have 6 months of learning on Codecademy. I have so far only covered HTML, CSS, JS, PYTHON, SQL, and currently in the lesson for Go (Golang)
