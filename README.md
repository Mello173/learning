## Git Testing Website / About Me

###### I am creating everything in this folder/repo as a way to learn Git and Github and how to use them together or seperately. 

###### This website is not going to be published anywhere or anything like that, but it is a small about me website to allow me to test my skills in the HTML, CSS, and a couple other languages at the same time as I learn git.

###### This was created while I have 6 months of learning on Codecademy. I have so far only covered HTML, CSS, JS, PYTHON, SQL, CLI, and currently in the lesson for Go (Golang)

###### About Me page is completed. 

###### Contact page has been started, once I learn php I will be able to finish the form that is part of the page.

###### Home page has not been started.

###### Portfolio page has not been started and I have nothing currently that could be added as part of my portfolio.
