## Project Title: Git Testing Website / About Me

#### Description:
#### This project is a website that I created for the purpose of learning how to use git, github, and also practice the skills for some of the languages I have learned.

##### I have learned some of each of the following languages:
  + HTML
  + CSS
  + Javascript
  + Python
  + SQL
  + Golang
  + Command Line

##### I have covered the basics for all of the above listed languages/programs. I have not mastered any of them yet but I am working on it. I have no real world experience in using them for an actual project other than what I have used in this project.
